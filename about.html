<p><b>We as students want to offer a helping hand wherever we can, during this coronavirus crisis as well as afterwards.</b> Our organisation provides a strong platform to help individuals set up their own local hub and support them throughout. These hubs connect volunteers with those who need help, whoever they are depending on the needs of that community. </p>
<p>StudentsAgainstCorona stresses (inter)national hygiene guidelines to avoid spreading the virus between volunteers and, most importantly, to those at-risk individuals who we are helping. We urge all volunteers to thoroughly read the <u> <a style="color: black;" href="../hygiene/">Recommended Hygiene Guidelines for Volunteers</a></u> and watch the instructional video before performing any tasks.
 
</p>
<p>If you are healthy, and at low risk, join this movement to help others in your community!</p>

                    We ask volunteers to also read the <u> <a style="color: black;" href="../hygiene/">Recommended Hygiene Guidelines for Volunteers</a></u> carefully and watch the ‘Volunteering Hygiene Video’ before you begin volunteering.

                    <p>With universities having closed around the world, several full-time students now find themselves free. The main way you can help is by setting up a hub in your own community. The hubs look at the needs of their respective communities and try to fill that. Usually, a hub has one of the following set-ups:</p>

                            <p class="pera1">If there is already a hub in your community you can sign up as a volunteer. Tasks vary per community. When helping on the ground this can consist of going grocery shopping, walking dogs, chatting over the phone or perhaps even getting involved in operations. When helping businesses the goal is to provide a platform for customers to buy vouchers to their favourite places. In a strict lockdown, helping consists of connecting businesses and local governments or providing logistics to get things like food to those in need. Furthermore, you can help by raising awareness on facts about the coronavirus and hygiene.

                                            <p>Operations mainly consist of making a large impact on the community through a variety of small tasks. The main focus is to connect volunteers to people in need. The most successful hubs have been able to discover and help the individual needs of their community. This can be through volunteers performing tasks; finding help that you as an organisation can’t offer yourself; providing volunteers for events or services operated by other organisations; or sharing hygiene recommendations with other initiatives that do not advise their own volunteers on hygiene. In short, collaboration with local organisations, government or private, provides the most help to your community and success.
